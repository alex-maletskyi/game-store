# Constraints
An important step to scoping your project is to discuss your group's constraints before you even begin thinking of user stories. 

Defining your constraints will help to define a realistic project and commit to it. Constraints can also help you to build a more creative project!

Some boundaries around the project.

## External

  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines: keep lookout in Notion (2 months)
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies: React, VS Code

## Internal: Involuntary

  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project: 2 months (Notion)

## Internal: Voluntary

  constraints that your team decided on to help scope & structure the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions: clean code
  - branching and workflow conventions: 
    - branch for every new collective feature (planning folder)
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working: 2-4 hrs/day
